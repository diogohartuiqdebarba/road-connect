# Road Connect

# Code convention

Clear and readable code, with functions and variables named descriptively, eliminating the need for most comments.

Avoiding extra spaces and comments helps maintain a dynamic reading in the code, enabling faster work and easier retention of information in mental memory.

# Optional Enhancements

 Multi-resolution support to seamlessly switch between landscape and portrait orientations.

 Localization support for "pt", "en" and "es".

# Bugs

The first bug founded was the level title, it starts in 0 instead 1. Not congruent with the level buttons in the menu.

The font "22203___.ttf" not worked because the filename started with number, so I rename to "FONT22203___.ttf".

It was necessary to remove the translations' accents because the font "FONT22203___.ttf" does not have them.
