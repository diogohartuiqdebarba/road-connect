# Code convention

I think if you need comment something in the code, with rare exceptions, is because you are making or thinking something wrong. So my code is clear and readable, the functions said what they do, and the variable what be are.

I avoid extra spaces and comments in my code, I like to read the code dynamically, this way I work faster and have everything in my mental memory more easily.

# Original project bugs

The first bug founded was the level title, it starts in 0 instead 1.
